# Real-Time 3D Face Detection and Glasses Augmentation

## Overview
This project demonstrates real-time 3D face detection and glasses augmentation using OpenCV and OpenGL. It detects faces in live video streams, calculates face landmarks, and overlays 3D glasses onto detected faces in real-time.

## Features
- **Real-time Face Detection:** Utilizes OpenCV's Haar Cascade classifier to detect faces in live video streams.
- **3D Glasses Augmentation:** Renders 3D glasses onto detected faces using OpenGL, ensuring realistic augmentation.
- **Demo Video:** Includes a demo video showcasing the project in action.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Trimesh
- NumPy
- PyOpenGL
- GLFW
